# MyReads Project

## Description

A single page application developed using React.js.
It works as an organized book reading tracker.
It allows you to search for books in Udacity's API, then pick any of the books to add them to your collection
It also allows you to choose which of the book you read, want to read or currently reading

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Project Structure

```bash
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── README.md - This file.
├── package.json # npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico # React Icon.

└── src
    ├── App.css # Styles for your app. Feel free to customize this as you desire.
    ├── App.js # This is the root of your app. Contains static HTML right now.
    ├── App.test.js # Used for testing. Provided with Create React App.
    ├── BooksAPI.js # A JavaScript API for the provided Udacity backend.
    ├── icons # Helpful images for your app.
    │   ├── add.svg
    │   ├── arrow-back.svg
    │   └── arrow-drop-down.svg
    ├── index.css # Global styles.
    └── index.js # Renders the UI
```

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms. That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
